                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Chain surveying is best suited for small, relatively flat, and open areas where triangulation is not necessary. It is not suitable for large or crowded areas due to its linear nature and lack of angular measurements."

                    explanation: "Crazing is the defect where a network of fine cracks appears on the painted surface, forming small enclosed areas. It is often caused by improper seasoning of wood, use of excessive drier, or poor quality paint."

IS codes are the Indian equivalents and NS 269:1976 covers a different material, so only the Nepal cement standard applies here."

                    explanation: "The maximum bending moment for a partial UDL on a simply supported beam depends on the load's position. For a symmetric load over the central 4m, the maximum moment is typically less than the full-span UDL case. Standard formulas or analysis yield a value of 4.5 kNm for this specific configuration."

                    explanation: "Stiffness is the force needed to produce unit displacement, k = P/δ, so its SI unit is newtons per metre. Its reciprocal is flexibility, in m/N, and the same idea extends to rotational stiffness, measured in N·m per radian — which is why beam stiffness appears as 4EI/L rather than a plain force."

The material of the structure affects its strength and response to the pressure, but not the magnitude of the wind pressure itself."

The pressure intensity at the base is Ka × γ × H = (1/3) × 18 × 6 = 36 kN/m². Note this is the intensity at the bottom of the wall, not the total thrust: the pressure grows linearly from zero at the surface, so the resultant is ½ × 36 × 6 = 108 kN per metre run, acting at H/3 above the base."

                    explanation: "A watershed canal runs along the ridge line (or watershed) dividing two drainage areas. Since it is located at the highest point between catchments, it does not cross any natural streams or drainage lines - hence, no cross drainage structures (like aqueducts or culverts) are required. Side Slope Canal: Runs along a slope; may intersect streams -&gt; cross drainage structures often needed. Contour Canal: Follows the contour but may still cross small drains. Field Channel: Carries water to fields; may not need large structures, but not the correct classification in this context."

A four-axle vehicle carries a constant of 330, so the design EWL is that figure multiplied by the number of such vehicles expected over the design life. Heavier configurations carry much larger constants, which is why a few multi-axle trucks can dominate the pavement design."

It occurs when the mix carries more bitumen than the aggregate voids can hold, and traffic loading in hot weather squeezes the excess up. The remedy is to blot the surface with sand or chippings and correct the binder content in the mix design."
