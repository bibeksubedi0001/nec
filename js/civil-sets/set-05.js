                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "About a centroidal axis parallel to the x-axis the depth d is the dimension being cubed, giving I equal to bd cubed over 12. Turning the section through 90 degrees swaps the roles, so bending about the other axis uses db cubed over 12."

                    explanation: "The centroid of a solid hemisphere lies on its axis at 3r over 8 from the flat face, because the cross-sectional area shrinks towards the pole and most of the volume is concentrated near the base."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "A solid with a polygonal base whose other faces are triangles meeting at a common apex is a pyramid. A prism has two identical parallel bases joined by rectangles, and a cone has a circular base with a curved surface."

                    explanation: "Radius of gyration is k equal to the root of I over A, so it is proportional to the root of the moment of inertia, to the root of the inverse of the area, and to the root of their ratio. Every option listed is therefore a valid proportionality."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Setting the level midway between the two staves makes the sight lengths equal, so the curvature correction and the refraction correction are the same at both readings and cancel in the difference. The collimation error cancels for the same reason."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "The GPS constellation operated by the US Department of Defense nominally comprises 24 satellites in six orbital planes, which guarantees that at least four are visible from anywhere on Earth, the minimum needed to fix position and receiver clock error."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Face left and face right zenith angles must sum to 360 degrees. Subtracting 98 degrees 30 minutes 30 seconds from 360 gives 261 degrees 29 minutes 30 seconds, and observing on both faces cancels the collimation and trunnion axis errors."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Topographic survey supplies the ground model for every kind of study listed: soil and geological mapping, engineering design of roads, canals and structures, and traffic and land-use planning all start from the same contoured plan."

                    explanation: "A geographic information system defines and stores map geometry, represents cartographic features and retrieves and analyses data. Simply transferring files between machines is ordinary data handling and is not what distinguishes a GIS."

A higher penetration number means a softer, more fluid bitumen, which is why 80/100 grade is used in cold regions and 30/40 in hot ones. The key has been corrected from the printed 0.62 mm, which is a factor of ten out."
