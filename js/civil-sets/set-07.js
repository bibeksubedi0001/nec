                    explanation: "The closing error has a northerly component, since north latitudes exceed south, and a westerly component, since west departures exceed east. A bearing with north and west components lies in the north-west quadrant."

Designated length is 100 links, actual is 100.8 links. True Area = 100 * (100.8/100)² = 100 * 1.016064 = 101.6064 acres ≈ 101.6 acres."

                    explanation: "The slope correction formula for a length L is C = L - Lcosα ≈ L(1 - cosα). For small angles, cosα ≈ 1 - α²/2 (α in radians). Converting degrees to radians (α_rad = α° * π/180 ≈ α/57.3), the approximation leads to a standard formula often given as Correction = L(α²/2) with α in radians. For a 100 link chain and α in degrees, a common approximation is Correction (in links) = 1.5α²/100. Verified"

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "In a three-hinged arch the moment at the crown hinge must vanish, so H times the rise equals the simple-beam moment at the crown. The reactions are 68 kN and 12 kN, giving a crown moment of 68 times 20 minus 80 times 14, that is 240 kNm. Dividing by the 8 m rise gives H equal to 30 kN. The key has been corrected from the printed 100 kN."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "In the context of pavement design for undivided roads, the Lane Distribution Factor (D) represents the proportion of total commercial traffic that is expected to occupy the design lane. For a Single Lane road, the factor is 1.0, meaning 100% of the traffic in both directions is concentrated in that one lane. On a Two-Lane undivided road, the factor reduces to 0.75, as it is assumed that 75% of the total two-way traffic will affect the design lane. For a Four-Lane undivided road, the distribution is even wider, resulting in a factor of 0.40, indicating that only 40% of the total two-way traffic is used to calculate the structural requirements for the most heavily used lane."

                    explanation: "Pavement damage follows the fourth power law, so the damage caused is proportional to the fourth power of the axle load ratio. Doubling the load from 80 to 160 kN therefore does 2 to the fourth, that is 16 times, as much damage."
