                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Bitumen is thermoplastic: it softens and flows when warm and stiffens as it cools. In winter the binder becomes hard and brittle, so the pavement loses flexibility and is prone to cracking, while in summer the same material softens and can rut or bleed. That is why grades are chosen to suit the local temperature range."

                    explanation: "The grade number (e.g., 30/40) indicates the penetration value range. A lower penetration value means the bitumen is harder. Therefore, 30/40 is harder than 60/70 or 80/100."

                    explanation: "Nepal Standard NS 49:2041 specifies burnt clay bricks, covering dimensions, compressive strength, water absorption and efflorescence. Meeting it is what allows a brick to be graded first, second or third class, and the class in turn decides where in the structure it may be used."

(Note: This answer does not match the options provided. Rechecking: v = 1 / ρ. ρ = m/V = 160 kg / 200 m³ = 0.8 kg/m³. Therefore, v = 1 / 0.8 kg/m³ = 1.25 m³/kg.
