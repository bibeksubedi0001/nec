                    explanation: "The centroid is the geometric center of a plane figure. It is the average position of all the points in the shape. For a uniform lamina (constant thickness and density), the centroid coincides with the center of gravity."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "The centroid of a semi-circular lamina lies at a distance of 4r/(3π) from its flat, straight edge (diameter), measured along the axis of symmetry. This is a standard formula."

                    explanation: "Circles, squares, and rectangles are symmetric shapes whose centroid is at their geometric center. A right-angled triangle is not symmetric about its center; its centroid is located at the intersection of its medians, which is not the geometric center of the bounding box."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "The radius of gyration about a diameter of a circular section is k equal to the root of I over A, which reduces to d over 4. For a 10 cm plate that is 2.5 cm. Radius of gyration is what converts a slenderness ratio into an effective length, so it is central to column design."

                    explanation: "The axis about which a moment of area is taken is the axis of reference. Moving to a parallel axis changes the value by A times the square of the distance between them, which is the parallel axis theorem, so a second moment of area means nothing until the axis it refers to is stated."

For n=1 (Newtonian fluid), K becomes dynamic viscosity with dimensions [M L⁻¹ T⁻¹], which is independent of time? Actually, for n=1, it is independent of time? The dimension of K is [M L⁻¹ T^(n-2)]. For it to be independent of time, the exponent of T must be 0, so n-2=0, hence n=2. But the option is 1. There might be a confusion. The question asks for 'dimension independent of time', meaning the exponent of time is zero. So, n-2=0, n=2. However, the provided answer in the text is (b) 1. This is a discrepancy. Based on dimension analysis, n=2 is correct for time-independent dimension of K."

This result does not match the options, suggesting the value 'c/a' in the question might be the coefficient C itself, perhaps with a value of 2.2 or similar. If C is taken as 2.2, q = 2.2 * (1.2)^(3/2) ≈ 2.2 * 1.314 ≈ 2.89, still not matching. The closest option based on standard C values (around 2.0-2.3) is 4.27 if H is used differently.

As the load moves deeper, it spreads over a larger area, which reduces the pressure (stress) on the underlying soil. This distribution is typically modeled as a truncated cone (or a frustum)."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Settling or sedimentation ponds are simple earthen basins in which the flow is slowed enough for entrained solids to fall out under gravity.

                    explanation: "A clarifier is a sedimentation tank fitted with a slowly rotating or travelling scraper that pushes settled sludge to a hopper for continuous withdrawal, and usually a surface skimmer for floating matter.
