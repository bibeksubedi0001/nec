                    explanation: "The primary aim of compaction is to increase the soil's density and strength. This is achieved by reducing the volume of air voids, i.e., decreasing the void ratio. A lower void ratio leads to higher dry density, lower permeability, and higher shear strength."

                    explanation: "Compaction increases the dry density of a soil by rearranging particles and reducing the volume of voids. Since porosity (n) is the ratio of volume of voids to total volume, a decrease in void volume directly results in decreased porosity."

Then y_c = 2/3 E = 0.373m, but given depth 0.5m, so not critical. This is tricky. Perhaps they want the shear stress at the bed based on the energy gradient? Another way: average shear stress = γ R S_f, and S_f = dE/dx. Not given. Perhaps for the given specific energy, we can find the slope if we assume uniform flow. But not enough info.
