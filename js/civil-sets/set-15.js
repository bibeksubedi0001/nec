                    explanation: "A queen closer is a brick cut lengthwise into two halves (9 cm x 4.5 cm x 9 cm). A half queen closer is half of that again, cut across the width, resulting in dimensions of 9 cm (length) x 4.5 cm (width) x 4.5 cm (height). The option 9 cm x 4.5 cm x 9 cm is the standard dimension for a queen closer, not a half. The correct dimension for a half queen closer is 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 9 cm, but this is not listed. Among the given options, 9 cm x 4.5 cm x 9 cm is the standard queen closer, which is the closest relevant answer."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Double Flemish bond is less strong and less compact than English bond but provides a better aesthetic appearance on both sides. The answer 'None' implies it is not stronger."

Setting that equal to 324 over 25 with an area of 24 gives the root of D as 1.852, so D is 3.43 m. The hydraulic depth is A over T, so the top width is 24 divided by 3.43, which is about 7 m.

Manning's formula: Q = (1/n) * A * R^(2/3) * S^(1/2) = (1/0.02) * 12.5 * (1.25)^(2/3) * √0.002 = 50 * 12.5 * (1.25^(0.6667)) * 0.04472. 1.25^(2/3)≈1.157. So Q = 50 * 12.5 * 1.157 * 0.04472 ≈ 50*12.5=625, 625*1.157=723.125, 723.125*0.04472≈32.34. Not exact; recalc: 1.25^(2/3)= (1.25^2)^(1/3)=1.5625^(1/3)≈1.165. Then 50*12.5=625, 625*1.165=728.125, 728.125*0.04472≈32.56. Still not matching. Perhaps use Chezy. But the option \"31.43m³/s\" 31.43 is given."
