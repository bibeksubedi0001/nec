                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "The centroid of a volume is the average location of the volume's points. It is the point where the total volume can be considered to be concentrated for certain calculations, analogous to the centroid of an area."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "The conditions for static equilibrium in 3D are ∑Fx=0, ∑Fy=0, ∑Fz=0, ∑Mx=0, ∑My=0, ∑Mz=0. The centroid is found using the moment equations (like ∑Mx = ȳ * V), not force equilibrium. All ∑F=0 are necessary for overall equilibrium but are not the direct equations used to *find* the centroid location. the option \"∑Mz = 0\" is listed twice, likely a typo, but the concept is that force balance is a condition for the body being in equilibrium, not the calculation method for the centroid itself. The question asks which is *not* the condition used *for the calculations* of the centroid. The formulas used are x̄ = (∫ x dV)/V, etc., not ∑F=0."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Different formulas can be applied for earthwork calculations depending on the site conditions and required accuracy. The mid-section, trapezoidal, and prismoidal formulas are all valid methods for calculating volumes in such scenarios."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "The trapezoidal formula assumes that the volume between two cross-sections is the average of their areas multiplied by the distance between them. This is valid only if the end sections are parallel planes."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Simpson's method (or rule) provides a more accurate estimation of volume for irregular shapes because it approximates the ground profile as a series of parabolas, whereas the trapezoidal rule uses straight lines."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "The included angle between two lines can be found by the difference in their bearings. Since both are fore bearings, the angle = F.B. of BC - F.B. of AB = 15° - 35° = -20° or 340°. However, the included interior angle is 180° - 20° = 160° if the lines are deflecting."

So, d = 2σ/ΔP = (2*0.075)/750 = 0.0002 m = 0.2 mm. Not in options. If it's a soap bubble in water, it has two surfaces? The options suggest d=0.4mm. If ΔP=8σ/d for soap bubble, d=8σ/ΔP=8*0.075/750=0.0008m=0.8mm. the option \"0.8\" is 0.8. The question says 'soap bubble inside a bucket of water', which is complex. Typically, for a gas bubble in liquid, it's 2σ/d. The intended answer is likely 0.4 or 0.8. Given the options, 0.4 is listed, but calculation doesn't match. There might be a unit error. ΔP=0.075 N/cm²=75 N/m²? Then d=2*0.075/75=0.002m=2mm, not in options. This is ambiguous."
