                    explanation: "In differential leveling, the difference in elevation between the starting and ending points is equal to the sum of all back sights minus the sum of all fore sights. ΣBS - ΣFS = Last RL - First RL."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "The correction to reduce a length measured at height H above MSL to its equivalent length at MSL is C_msl = (L * H) / R.

                    explanation: "The plinth level is the level at which the superstructure sits on the foundation. The DPC is placed here, typically 150-200 mm above ground level, to prevent ground moisture from rising into the walls."

                    explanation: "Simple or pure bending describes a length of beam over which the bending moment is constant, which means the shear force, being the derivative of the moment, is zero. The two-point loading arrangement creates such a zone between the loads, which is why it is used for flexure testing."

                    explanation: "The simple bending theory assumes the material has the same modulus of elasticity in tension and compression, so the stress distribution is linear and the neutral axis passes through the centroid. Where that is not true, as in cast iron or concrete, the neutral axis shifts towards the stiffer side."
