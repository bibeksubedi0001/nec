                    explanation: "As per standard practice, half-brick thick walls (typically 10 cm or 4.5 inches) are measured in square meters, while thicker walls, reinforced brickwork, and arches are measured in cubic meters."

                    explanation: "Estimating uses the metric units consistently: length in metres, area in square metres and volume in cubic metres, with mass in kilogrammes or quintals. Getting the unit right matters because the rate in the schedule is quoted per that unit, and mixing them is one of the commonest sources of error in a bill of quantities."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "The trapezoidal formula assumes the volume between two cross-sections is the average of their areas multiplied by the distance between them. This is valid only if the end sections are parallel planes. The other statements relate to the prismoidal formula."

                    explanation: "The mid-section formula is a simplified earthwork calculation method where the area of a section midway between two original sections is computed and multiplied by the distance between them to find the volume."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Given the common centerline calculation for a building (e.g., 20m total centerline length), the out-to-out long wall length is often given directly (6.80m), and the in-to-in short wall length is derived by subtracting the wall thickness from the centerline length (e.g., 4m - 0.8m = 3.20m if thickness is 0.4m). All statements align with this logic."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "The center line method is a common technique for building estimation. All the statements accurately describe the rules and adjustments made when using this method to calculate quantities."

                    explanation: "Highway cross-sections are always taken perpendicular (at a right angle) to the centerline of the road to accurately represent the topography and calculate earthwork volumes. The spacing (30m, 50m) can vary but the right-angle rule is constant."
