                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "A 30 m metric chain has 150 links, each 200 mm long, with brass tags at every 5 m to make counting quick. The older 20 m chain has 100 links of the same length, so the link count follows directly from the chain length."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "If the chain is shorter than standard, it will take more 'chain lengths' to cover a distance, resulting in a recorded distance that is longer than the true distance. This is a positive error."

                    explanation: "Compensating errors are random errors that tend to cancel out over a series of measurements. Their magnitude is often considered to be proportional to the square root of the length L (√L)."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "If a chain is too short, the error is often due to bent links. Straightening these bent links will effectively lengthen the chain back towards its standard length."

The squared term is why slenderness dominates: doubling the length quarters the buckling load, whatever the strength of the material."

Note: The options seem inconsistent with the given data; rechecking the problem might be needed. The calculation based on standard formula gives 16 kNm, but 84 kNm is the closest option if depth is 400mm and width is larger, but the question says 'off grid to 40 mm depth 400 mm' which might be a typo. Assuming b=40mm, d=400mm, the calculated M is 16 kNm. However, based on the options, 84 kNm might be for a different dimension. The description will follow the standard calculation."

                    explanation: "The section factor Z for critical flow calculations is given by Z = A√D, where A is the area and D is the hydraulic depth (A/T, T is top width). Discharge Q = A * V. Given Q=250 m³/s and V=5 m/s, area A = Q/V = 250/5 = 50 m². The section factor Z = A√D = 50√D = 111.80. Solving for D: √D = 111.80 / 50 = 2.236, therefore D = (2.236)² = 5 m. (Note: The calculation yields 5m, making the option \"5 m\" correct. The initial answer of 4m was based on an error. The correct answer is 5m.)"

Given discharge (Q) = 75 m³/s and velocity (V) = 5 m/s, the area A = Q/V = 75/5 = 15 m². Hydraulic depth (D_h) = A / Top Width (T) = 3m. Therefore, T = A / D_h = 15 / 3 = 5m. For a rectangular channel with depth y, A = T * y = 5 * y = 15, so y = 3m. Wetted Perimeter P = T + 2y = 5 + 2*3 = 11m. Hydraulic Radius R = A/P = 15/11 ≈ 1.3636m. The closest option is 1.87m, which suggests a possible error in the provided options or a misinterpretation. Rechecking: If hydraulic depth is given as 3m, and A=15m², then T=5m. For a rectangular channel, hydraulic depth is just the depth (y) if we consider the standard definition (A/T). So y=3m. Then P = B + 2y = 5 + 6 = 11m. R = 15/11 = 1.3636m. But 1.36m is an option. However, the \"correct\" answer is listed as 1.87m in the key, indicating a potential discrepancy. Based on calculation, it should be 1.36m."

C (comfort criterion, rate of change of acceleration) = 0.6 m/s³ (IRC). L = 2 * [ (0.005 * (22.22)³) / 0.6 ]^(1/2) = 2 * [ (0.005 * 10973.4) / 0.6 ]^(1/2) = 2 * [ (54.867) / 0.6 ]^(1/2) = 2 * [91.445]^(1/2) = 2 * 9.563 ≈ 19.126 m. The exact calculation might yield 19.52m depending on the formula and constants used (sometimes L = (N * V³) / (C * 3.6) for V in km/h). Recalculating with V in km/h: L = (N * V³) / (C * 3.6) = (0.005 * 80³) / (0.6 * 3.6) = (0.005 * 512000) / (2.16) = 2560 / 2.16 ≈ 1185.19m (this is incorrect for comfort). The initial calculation is standard. The option 19.52 is closest to the calculated 19.126m, likely using a precise formula."
