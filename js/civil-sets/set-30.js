                    explanation: "Shallow excavation works like surface dressing (up to 15 cm) and surface excavation (up to 30 cm) are measured in area (sq.m), not volume, due to their minimal depth."

Reinforced brick work (cu.m.): Measured by volume as it is a solid, three-dimensional structural element with varying length, width, and thickness. Brick edging (Running meters): Measured by linear length since its cross-section (the size of a single brick) remains constant along the border. Brick work in arches (cu.m.): Measured by volume because it forms a 3D structural span requiring calculations for length, depth, and wall thickness. Verified"
