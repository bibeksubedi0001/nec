                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Waterproof tiles are laid on terraces, in bathrooms and in kitchens to form a continuous impervious skin, so that water runs off to the outlet instead of soaking into the slab below. Keeping the water out also protects the reinforcement from corrosion."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Gutters and valley linings are sealed with bitumen, which stays flexible, sticks to the substrate and is completely impervious, so the joint can move with temperature without cracking. Cement and sand would crack under that movement and let water through."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "A corbel or projecting cornice course is built out from the wall face to give a truss or beam a bearing surface. Coping caps the top of a wall to throw water off, a frieze is a decorative band and a lintel spans an opening."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "For any figure with two axes of symmetry, such as a circle, a square or a rectangle, the centroid sits at the geometric centre. A right-angled triangle has no such symmetry, so its centroid lies at one third of the height and one third of the base from the right angle."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "About its own base a triangle has a second moment of area of bh cubed over 12. Shifting to the centroidal axis, which is h/3 above the base, reduces it to bh cubed over 36 by the parallel axis theorem."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "In triangulation a well conditioned triangle keeps every angle above about 30 degrees and below about 120 degrees. Very acute or very obtuse triangles make the computed lengths extremely sensitive to small angular errors, so the fix becomes weak."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "A hollow circular section is treated as the solid outer circle minus the hole, so I equals pi over 64 times the difference of the fourth powers of the outer and inner diameters. Because the fourth power dominates, metal near the outside contributes far more stiffness, which is why tubes are efficient."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "A semicircle about its diameter has half the second moment of area of the full circle, that is half of pi D to the fourth over 64, which gives pi D to the fourth over 128."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "About its base a rectangle has I equal to bd cubed over 3. The centroidal value is bd cubed over 12, and the parallel axis theorem adds A times (d/2) squared, that is bd cubed over 4, to make up the difference."
                },

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "The centroid of a solid cone lies on its axis at one quarter of the height above the base, because the cross-sectional area falls off as the square of the distance from the apex, concentrating the volume near the base."
                },

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "A hollow circular section is the solid outer circle minus the hole, so I equals pi over 64 times (D to the fourth minus d to the fourth). That is pi over 64 times (160,000 minus 10,000), which gives about 7363 cm to the fourth. Because the fourth power dominates, the small central hole removes only about six percent of the stiffness while saving a quarter of the material."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Measured from the side of length b, the centroid of a trapezium lies at h over 3 times (b plus 2a) divided by (b plus a). Setting a equal to b recovers h/2 for a rectangle, and setting a to zero gives h/3 for a triangle, which is a useful check."

                    explanation: "Immediate or elastic settlement occurs as soon as the load is applied, before any water is expelled, so it is computed from elasticity theory using the soil's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Consolidation settlement, which follows, needs Terzaghi's theory instead."

                    explanation: "A clay that has carried a higher effective pressure at some time in the past than it does today is over-consolidated. It behaves stiffly on reloading until that preconsolidation pressure is passed, after which it compresses along the much steeper virgin curve."

                    explanation: "Steady seepage parallel to an infinite slope roughly halves the factor of safety compared with the same slope when dry, because buoyancy cuts the effective normal stress while the seepage force drives the soil downslope. This is why slopes so often fail during prolonged rain."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Bulking is the increase in the volume of loose sand caused by a film of moisture holding the grains apart by surface tension. It peaks at about 4 to 6 percent moisture and disappears when the sand is fully saturated, which matters when concrete is batched by volume."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "Cohesion is a property of clay, not of sand, so a clean dense sand has essentially none. Among clays it rises with stiffness, giving hard clay the greatest value, then medium and soft clay, with dense sand ranking below hard clay."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Consolidation is the slow squeezing out of pore water from a saturated fine-grained soil, and the soil compresses as the water leaves. Expelling air is compaction, which is immediate and mechanical rather than time dependent."

                    explanation: "Raising the water table above ground level adds the same weight of water to both the total stress and the pore pressure, so the effective stress in the soil below stays unchanged. Raising it within the soil, however, buoys the grains and does reduce the effective stress."

                    explanation: "Effective stress is the ratio of force at the contact of particles of soil to the total area. It cannot be obtained practically but we can calculate the effective stress by measuring total stress and pore water pressure as: $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{Total stress } (\\sigma) &= \\text{effective stress } (\\sigma') + \\text{pore water pressure } (u) \\\\ \\text{Effective stress } (\\sigma') &= \\text{Total stress } (\\sigma) - \\text{pore water pressure } (u) \\end{aligned}$$ If we increase the ground water table then value of pore water pressure increases and effective stress decreases.If we lowering the groundwater table below ground then the value of pore water pressure decreases and effective stress increases.
