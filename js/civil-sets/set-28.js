                    explanation: "In a triangulation network, the area is divided into triangles that are as close to equilateral as possible. These are called 'well-conditioned triangles' as they minimize the propagation of errors in the computation of sides."

They undergo significant plastic deformation (barreling) and may not fracture at all in a standard test. If fracture occurs, it is often complex and not on a single defined plane, making the answer 'cannot be determined' the most accurate."
