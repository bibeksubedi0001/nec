                    explanation: "The major oxides in cement are Lime (CaO), Silica (SiO₂), Alumina (Al₂O₃), and Iron oxide (Fe₂O₃). Silica (SiO₂) typically constitutes about 17-25% of the raw materials used in cement manufacturing. It imparts strength to the cement."

                    explanation: "The Bogue compounds are the four main chemical compounds (minerals) formed during the burning process in cement kilns. They are: Tricalcium silicate (C3S), Dicalcium silicate (C2S), Tricalcium aluminate (C3A), and Tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C4AF)."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "The density of cement in its loose, packaged state is approximately 1440 kg/m³. This is a standard value used for calculations in concrete mix design and quantity estimation."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "Lime mortar and plaster gain strength through a slow process of carbonation (reaction with atmospheric CO₂). While it continues for a long time, a typical initial curing period of 7 days is often recommended to ensure it sets properly and doesn't dry out too quickly, which would stop the reaction."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Exogenous trees grow outward by adding concentric rings each year (secondary growth). Sal (Shorea robusta) is a hardwood exogenous tree. Bamboo, Palm, and Cane are monocots and are endogenous; they grow in height by primary growth only, not in girth by adding rings."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Seasoning is the process of reducing the moisture content in timber. For indoor use, well-seasoned timber should have a moisture content between 10% and 12% to minimize subsequent shrinkage, warping, or decay."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Rind galls are abnormal swelling or growth on the bark of a tree, often caused by injuries or improper pruning, where new sapwood grows abnormally over a wound. In timber, this defect manifests as distorted, swollen patches that reduce wood quality, strength, and value due to the irregular wood fibers."

                    explanation: "Brazing is a process that uses a filler metal with a melting point above 450°C (842°F). Common brazing solders (spelter) are alloys of copper and zinc (e.g., 60% Cu, 40% Zn). Soft soldering uses low-melting-point alloys of tin and lead."

Coal yields tar, which is chemically different and more brittle, and kerosene is one of the light fractions rather than a source."

Trichloroethylene is now often used instead because carbon disulphide is dangerously flammable."

                    explanation: "The slenderness ratio (λ) is calculated as Effective Length / Least Lateral Dimension. For a column fixed at both ends, effective length (Lₑ) = 0.65L = 0.65 * 5000 = 3250 mm. Least lateral dimension = 400 mm. λ = 3250 / 400 = 8.125. As per IS 456:2000, a column is long if λ &gt; 12. Since 8.125 &lt; 12, it is a short column. However, the question states \"square column\" but dimensions are 400x500mm (rectangular). The least dimension is 400mm. λ=8.125 which is less than 12, so it should be a short column. But the provided correct answer is \"Long column\". This might be a trick or error in the question. Rechecking: Unsupported length = 5000mm, Least lateral dimension = 400mm. For column with both ends fixed, effective length = 0.65 * 5000 = 3250mm. Slenderness ratio = 3250/400 = 8.125. Since 8.125 &lt; 12, it is a short column. But the answer given is \"Long column\". Possibly a misprint in the question or options. However, based on standard calculation, it should be short column. But the correct answer as per the test might be \"Long column\" due to some other interpretation. Alternatively, if we consider the larger dimension for buckling, but that is not standard. Standard is least lateral dimension. So, the description should clarify that as per calculation it is short, but the answer might be intended as long. However, the user provided the correct answer as \"Long column\", so we go with that."
