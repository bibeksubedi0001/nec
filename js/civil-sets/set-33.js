                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "For 1:2:4 concrete, the volume of coarse aggregate is 4/7 of the total concrete volume. For 1 cum concrete, CA = 4/7 cum. For 100 cum, CA = (4/7)*100 ≈ 57.14 cum. This seems off. Standard: Dry volume for 1 cum concrete is 1.54 cum. CA volume = (4/7)*1.54 = 0.88 cum per cum of concrete. For 100 cum, 88 cum."

                    explanation: "Cavitation occurs in machines where there is a pressure drop below the vapor pressure of the fluid. This is common in reaction turbines (like Francis or Kaplan) and centrifugal pumps, where high flow velocities can cause localized low-pressure zones. Impulse turbines (like Pelton wheels) operate at atmospheric pressure, and reciprocating pumps typically have higher pressure, reducing cavitation risk."

Energy = 0.782 * 1000 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 150 m * 1 m³ = 1,150,701.3 Joules. Since 1 kWh = 3,600,000 Joules, Energy (kWh) = 1,150,701.3 / 3,600,000 ≈ 0.3196 kWh. This result does not match any options. Recalculating for power: P = η * ρ * g * Q * H. For Q=1 m³/s, P = 0.782 * 1000 * 9.81 * 1 * 150 = 1,150,713 W = 1150.7 kW. If this power is generated for 1 hour, the energy is 1150.7 kWh.

This is the fundamental water need at the root zone. Consumptive Irrigation Requirement (CIR - 1): This is essentially the same as NIR. It is the amount of irrigation water required to meet the evapotranspiration needs of the crop, excluding effective rainfall and other contributions. Therefore, NIR and CIR are nearly identical and form the base amount. Field Irrigation Requirement (FIR - 3): This is the amount of water that must be delivered to the field to meet the NIR. It accounts for water application losses within the field (e.g., deep percolation, surface runoff). FIR = NIR / Application Efficiency. Gross Irrigation Requirement (GIR - 4): This is the total amount of water that must be diverted from the water source to meet the FIR. It includes the FIR plus all conveyance losses in the canals or pipes from the source to the field. GIR = FIR / Conveyance Efficiency. Thus, the values increase as you account for more losses: NIR/CIR (crop need) &lt; FIR (includes field losses) &lt; GIR (includes field and conveyance losses)"
