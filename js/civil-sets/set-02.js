                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Steel formwork is preferred where forms are reused many times: it is dimensionally stable, does not warp or absorb water, gives a smooth off-form finish and survives 100 or more uses. Timber and bamboo distort after a few pours, and stone is not a formwork material at all."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Tricalcium silicate (C3S) hydrates quickly and is responsible for the strength gained in the first 7 to 28 days. C2S reacts slowly and governs later strength, C3A causes flash set and is controlled by gypsum, and C4AF contributes mainly colour rather than strength."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Soaking serves every purpose listed: it washes away dust and loose particles, it stops the dry brick from sucking the mixing water out of the mortar (which would leave the mortar unhydrated and weak), and the wet surface lets mortar spread evenly."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "The frog is the shallow depression moulded into the top face of a brick. It keys the mortar so the bed joint resists sliding, reduces the weight of the unit, and carries the manufacturer's identification mark."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "With equal point loads placed symmetrically, the shear force between the two loads is zero, so the bending moment is constant and at its maximum across the whole central region, mid-span included. This zone of pure bending is exactly why the arrangement is used in flexure testing."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "A rough background gives the plaster a mechanical key. Old smooth concrete or dense brickwork must be hacked, raked or given a spatterdash coat, otherwise the plaster has nothing to grip and later debonds and hollows."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Electrical seasoning passes a high-frequency current through the timber, which heats it internally and drives moisture out very quickly. The steep moisture gradient that results sets up internal stresses and splits the timber, and the high power cost keeps the method from general use."
                },

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "Quartzite is a metamorphosed sandstone made up almost entirely of quartz grains, so it is classed as a siliceous rock. Calcareous rocks are lime based, such as limestone and marble, while argillaceous rocks such as slate are clay based."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Pigment is the finely ground solid that gives paint its colour, opacity and much of its durability. The vehicle or binder is the liquid medium that carries the pigment, wets the surface and forms the film as it dries."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Hydraulic lime contains clay impurities that let it set and harden in the presence of water, so it can be used for mortar in walls and in damp locations. Fat lime hardens only by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air and is used for plaster and whitewash."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Plastic bitumen is bitumen blended with a fine inert filler to give a stiff, putty-like consistency. It is applied to seal cracks and small openings, where it stays in place instead of flowing out like ordinary hot bitumen."

                    explanation: "Limestone supplies the calcium carbonate that becomes the lime in cement clinker and makes up roughly three quarters of the raw mix. Clay or shale supplies the silica, alumina and iron, while coal is a fuel rather than a raw material."

                    explanation: "Lacquer is a spirit varnish: a resin dissolved in a volatile solvent that dries purely by evaporation, leaving a hard film in minutes. Oil varnishes and enamels dry far more slowly because the film has to oxidise or cure chemically."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "A couple applied at a support is carried by the beam as bending, not as a transverse force. With equal end moments the support reactions come out zero, so the shear-force diagram has zero ordinates at the supports and the beam is in pure bending."

                    explanation: "Shear force is the slope of the bending-moment diagram, since V equals dM/dx. Where the shear passes through zero the slope of the moment diagram is zero, which is the stationary point where the bending moment reaches its maximum."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "The neutral axis is the layer where the fibres neither stretch nor shorten, so the bending stress there is zero. For a symmetrical section the shear stress distribution is parabolic with its peak at that same level, which is why webs are checked for shear at the neutral axis."

                    explanation: "At ultimate shear failure the resistance comes from several sources acting together: the uncracked concrete in the compression zone, aggregate interlock across the crack, dowel action of the longitudinal bars and the stirrups crossing the crack. No single option listed covers that combination."

Dividing the bulk unit weight by (1 plus w) removes the water; G gamma w over (1 plus e) works from the void ratio; and the form with the air voids fraction, (1 minus na) G gamma w over (1 plus wG), is the one used in compaction work because it lets you plot the zero-air-void line. Which one you use is decided purely by which data you happen to have."

This sieve size acts as the dividing line between fine aggregates (like sand) and coarse aggregates (like gravel or crushed stone) in standard grading tests like sieve analysis. The other options are incorrect: A. 75 microns (or 0.075mm) is the sieve size used to differentiate between sand and finer materials like silt and clay. B. 2.36mm is a standard sieve size for grading fine aggregates but is not the size that defines the overall classification as fine or coarse.

                    explanation: "Buoyancy is the upward thrust exerted by the surrounding fluid, equal to the weight of fluid displaced and acting opposite to the weight of the body. It arises because pressure increases with depth, so the upward push on the base exceeds the downward push on the top."
