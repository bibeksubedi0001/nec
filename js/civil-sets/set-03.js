                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Seasoning dries the timber down to the moisture content it will settle at in service. Removing that water stops the shrinkage, warping and splitting that would otherwise happen after the member is fixed, and dry timber is far less prone to fungal decay and insect attack."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Ordinary Portland cement must not begin to stiffen sooner than 30 minutes, so there is time to mix, transport, place and compact the concrete. The final setting time is limited at the other end to 600 minutes, that is 10 hours."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "A. Cracking of bricks: Reduces internal tensile stresses caused by rapid moisture loss. B. Shrinkage of bricks: Reduces overall volume contraction as water evaporates from the raw brick matrix. C. Warping of bricks: Prevents non-uniform volume change across the surfaces, ensuring the brick retains its flat faces and sharp edges."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "A first-class brick has to reach a compressive strength of at least 10.5 N/mm². Second-class bricks are allowed 7 N/mm² and third class 3.5 N/mm², so strength is one of the main grading criteria along with shape, colour and water absorption."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "The Vicat apparatus measures the standard consistency of cement paste, using the 10 mm plunger to find the water content that leaves the plunger 5 to 7 mm above the bottom. The same frame, fitted with the initial and final setting needles, then gives the setting times."
                },

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Soundness, the freedom from excessive expansion caused by unhydrated free lime, is measured with the Le Chatelier apparatus. The split mould is boiled and the spread of the indicator points is limited to 10 mm; the autoclave test is used where free magnesia is suspected."
                },

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "A first-class brick may absorb no more than 15 percent of its dry weight after 24 hours of immersion. Higher absorption points to under-burning and a porous structure, which lets damp through the wall and reduces frost resistance; second-class bricks are allowed up to 20 percent."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Le Chatelier's device tests soundness. Two indicator points on a split mould spread apart if free lime in the cement expands on hydration, and the measured spread must stay within the permitted limit or the hardened concrete would later crack and disintegrate."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Terracotta is a fine, moulded and burnt clay product used for ornamental work: cornices, brackets, string courses and decorative panels. It takes crisp moulded detail, weathers well and is much lighter than carved stone."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "The plinth area estimate is a preliminary estimate found by multiplying the plinth area of the proposed building by the plinth area rate of a recently completed building of similar specification, height and construction in the same locality."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "Every tread has a riser above and below it, but the topmost riser lands on the floor or landing, which is not counted as a tread. A flight therefore contains one fewer tread than risers."

                    explanation: "Raking bond is not a bond in its own right; the diagonal courses are laid inside thick walls simply to tie the middle of the wall together, so on its own it gives the least strength and the poorest transverse bond. English bond is the strongest, with Flemish and header bonds between."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "An applied couple is carried as a step in the bending-moment diagram, because the moment just to the left and just to the right of the point differ by the magnitude of the couple. Point loads produce a step in the shear-force diagram, not in the moment diagram."

                    explanation: "Under a uniformly distributed load the shear force is the reaction minus wx, so it falls linearly from plus wL/2 at one support to minus wL/2 at the other and passes through zero at mid-span, which is exactly where the bending moment peaks."

If the wall is pushed into the soil instead, the far larger passive pressure develops, and with no movement the at-rest pressure acts."

                    explanation: "Lining almost eliminates seepage and lets the channel run at a higher velocity in a smaller section, so far more of the diverted water reaches the fields and a larger command area can be served. It also lowers the water table alongside, which reduces waterlogging rather than increasing it."
