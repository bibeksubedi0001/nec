                    explanation: "A line ranger is used for ranging (aligning points on a line), not for measuring perpendicular offsets. Optical squares and cross staffs are specifically for setting right angles."

It differs from the true bearing by the magnetic declination at that place and date, and local attraction from iron or power lines can distort it further."

                    explanation: "Castigliano's second theorem states that the partial derivative of the total strain energy with respect to a load gives the deflection at that load, in its own direction. Where no load acts at the point of interest, a dummy load is applied and set to zero after differentiating."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "In a beam the strain energy stored in bending is far greater than that from shear or axial force, so deflection calculations use the bending term, the integral of M squared over 2EI, and neglect the rest. Shear deformation only becomes significant in deep beams, where the span to depth ratio is small."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "The shear strain energy is written as the integral of k V squared over 2AG, where k corrects for the fact that shear stress is not uniform over the section. The factor is 6/5 for a rectangle and 10/9 for a circle, both greater than one because the peak shear at the neutral axis exceeds the average."

                    explanation: "For a symmetrically loaded simply supported beam the elastic curve is flattest at mid-span, where the slope passes through zero, and tilts most sharply where it meets the supports. Deflection is the other way round, zero at the supports and greatest at mid-span, which is why slope and deflection limits control different sections."
