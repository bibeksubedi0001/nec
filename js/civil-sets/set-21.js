                    explanation: "Slope correction is subtractive (negative). If not applied, the measured slope distance is recorded, which is always longer than the horizontal distance. This error is systematic and cumulative, building up over the length of the line."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "Sensitivity depends on how freely the bubble can move for a small tilt. Higher viscosity resists that movement and higher surface tension holds the bubble in shape, so increasing either makes the bubble sluggish and the level less sensitive. A larger radius of curvature or a longer bubble does the opposite."

                    explanation: "Reciprocal leveling is used to find the difference in elevation between two points separated by an obstacle like a river, where the instrument cannot be placed midway. Levels are taken from both banks to eliminate errors."

Without the value of X (the ratio), we cannot find B uniquely. For example, if X=1/2, then y=B/2, so B*(B/2)=16, B²=32, B=5.66m. But 5.66 is not an option. If X=1/4, then y=B/4, B*(B/4)=16, B²=64, B=8m. So, if X=0.25, then B=8m. The question likely assumes a standard ratio, but it is not provided. Based on the answer being 8m, we can infer X=0.25."

Conveyance loss is 30%, meaning only 70% of the water released at the head reaches the field. Let Q be the discharge at the head. Then, 0.7Q = 18. Therefore, Q = 18 / 0.7 ≈ 25.71 cumec.
