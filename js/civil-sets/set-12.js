                    explanation: "The water absorption test directly measures the porosity of a brick. Higher absorption indicates more pores, which generally correlates with lower strength and frost resistance, but the test itself measures absorption, not strength directly."

                    explanation: "Fineness is determined by sieving cement through a standard sieve (e.g., 90μm). The residue left on the sieve should be minimal, meaning most grains are smaller than the mesh size."

                    explanation: "The Vicat test for normal consistency determines the water (% by weight of cement) needed. For OPC, this is typically around 26-33%, which is approximately 0.26P to 0.33P where P is the weight of cement. 0.78P is not the standard ratio. The correct concept is that the water is a percentage of the cement weight, not a multiple. The options seem erroneous. The standard is to find the percentage of water that allows the plunger to penetrate to a point 5-7mm from the bottom of the paste."

For Fe 250, it is 0.53d = 265 mm. But commonly, for Fe 415, it is 0.48d. However, the options include 245 and 265. The exact value as per IS 456 is x_u,max = 0.0035 / (0.0055 + 0.87f_y/E_s) * d. For Fe 415, f_y=415, E_s=2e5, so x_u,max = 0.0035 / (0.0055 + 0.87*415/200000) * d = 0.0035 / (0.0055 + 0.00180) * d = 0.0035/0.0073 * d = 0.479d = 239.5mm ~ 240mm. So, 245mm is close.
