                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Since the sum of North latitudes is greater than South latitudes, the resultant latitude is North. Since the sum of West departures is greater than East departures, the resultant departure is West. A line that is North and West points towards the North-West quadrant."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "A total station observes the horizontal angle, the vertical (or zenith) angle and the slope distance, from which it computes the horizontal and vertical components. Instrument and target heights are entered by the surveyor rather than measured by the instrument, so they are not readings."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "The included angle at B is the bearing of BA minus the bearing of BC. The back bearing of AB is 146 degrees 30 minutes plus 180, that is 326 degrees 30 minutes, and subtracting 68 degrees 30 minutes leaves 258 degrees, whose explement is the interior angle of 102 degrees."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "δ is the angle of misclosure, which represents the direction of the closing error. ΣD is the algebraic sum of the departures (East-West components) of all the lines in the traverse. ΣL is the algebraic sum of the latitudes (North-South components) of all the lines in the traverse. In a perfectly measured closed traverse, both ΣL and ΣD would equal zero. However, due to errors in measurement, they will have non-zero values, and their ratio determines the direction of the resultant closing error."

                    answer: "c",
                    explanation: "Chaining means measuring horizontal distance with chain/tape. Ranging means aligning intermediate points in straight line. Obstacles are categorized as: Obstacle to both chaining and ranging – e.g. building, hillock (they block line of sight &amp; also prevent chaining). Obstacle to chaining but not to ranging – e.g. river, because you can see across (ranging possible), but cannot directly measure with chain. Obstacle to ranging but not chaining – rare case when chaining possible but line of sight obstructed."

                    answer: "d",
                    explanation: "Bench marks are established during the detailed survey, once the alignment is fixed, so that every level taken during design and construction refers to the same datum. Reconnaissance and preliminary work only compare route options."

                    answer: "a",
                    explanation: "Contours can only merge into a single line where the ground face is vertical, as at a cliff, since two elevations then occur at the same plan position. Contours that actually crossed would mean overhanging ground, which is shown by a dashed convention."

                    answer: "b",
                    explanation: "A westerly declination means magnetic north lies west of true north, so the true bearing is the magnetic bearing minus the declination. Here 32 degrees minus 10 degrees 15 minutes gives 21 degrees 45 minutes."

                    explanation: "Binding wire is allowed at about 1 kg per quintal, that is roughly 1 percent of the weight of reinforcement. The exact figure depends on bar diameter and spacing, since more, smaller bars mean more intersections to tie."

                    explanation: "Spot welding (RSW) is an electrical resistance welding process that joins overlapping metals between two electrodes. Pressure is applied by squeezing the workpieces between the electrodes, and heat is generated by the passage of welding current through the resistive metals. This allows the materials to fuse and create a welding joint. The joint created through resistance spot welding resembles a button or a nugget, thus, the term spot welding was coined as the current is applied precisely over a small area on the metal’s surface."

Weak Jump (Fr₁ = 1.7 to 2.5): Small rollers develop on the surface with minor energy dissipation. Oscillating Jump (Fr₁ = 2.5 to 4.5): An unstable jet oscillates back and forth, causing irregular wave action and potential erosion. Steady Jump (Fr₁ = 4.5 to 9.0): A well-balanced, stable jump occurs with highly efficient energy dissipation. Strong Jump (Fr₁ &gt; 9.0): Highly turbulent, rough, and choppy flow takes place, used mainly downstream of large structures to destroy massive amounts of kinetic energy verified."

                    explanation: "A slow sand filter carries about 90 to 110 cm of fine sand over its gravel support. The depth matters because purification depends on the biological layer, the schmutzdecke, at the top and on the long path through the fine sand below."

                    explanation: "In a partly full circular sewer the flow area grows faster than the wetted perimeter until the depth is well past half full, so the discharge keeps increasing with depth.
